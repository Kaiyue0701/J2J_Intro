    <p>The Job-to-Job Flow Data (J2J data) produced by the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program of the US Census Bureau could be used to identify labor mobility across industries and geographies. The J2J data of the Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) could provide new insights to changing demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of region's population.</p>

    <p>By understanding the demographics of workers moving in and out of the Houston MSA, as well as the origin-destination information on location and industry sector changes, we could improve our regional growth forecast model to reflect more accurate migration scenarios and employment structures.</p>

    <p>Job-to-job moves are the primary activities to improve job matches between firms and workers and are important to a thriving economy. This application presents some of the essential information on the characters of job-to-job flows in the Houston MSA. The application contains the six following pages:</p>
